🎮 Henrique's Fun Game Collection
Welcome to my collection of simple and addictive games, all designed to run entirely in the terminal! 🎉
If you love playing around with classic games in the command line, you're in the right spot.

🕹️ What's Inside?
Guess the Number:
Try to guess the number in 10 attempts, or face terminal frustration! 😬

Hangman:
Save the stickman by guessing the letters of the word before it’s too late. Don’t let the hangman down! 😅

LeetCode Challenges:
I’ve added some LeetCode puzzles for those who enjoy a good challenge in the terminal. Test your coding and problem-solving skills! 💻

💡 Why the Terminal?
Because who doesn’t love the simplicity and charm of playing games directly from the command line? It’s fun, lightweight, and keeps your coding skills sharp! Plus, no fancy UIs to distract you. 😉

Languages: Java, Dart, Python, and who knows... maybe some others I’m exploring out there 🤔
